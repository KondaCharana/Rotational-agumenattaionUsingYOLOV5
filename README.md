# Rotational-agumenattaionUsingYOLOV5
To implement data augmentation techniques like random cropping, rotations, flipping, and color adjustments, you can use libraries such as PyTorch's torchvision.transforms or TensorFlow's tf.keras.preprocessing.image. These libraries offer a variety of transformation methods that you can apply to your training dataset.

Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to apply these augmentation techniques in a PyTorch pipeline:

Import the Necessary Libraries:
You need torchvision.transforms for the data augmentation functions and torch.utils.data.DataLoader to load the dataset with augmentations.
Define a Data Augmentation Pipeline:
Create a transforms.Compose object to combine multiple augmentation techniques.
Apply the Augmentation Pipeline to a Dataset:
Use the transform argument when creating a dataset to apply the augmentations.
Train with Augmented Data:
Use a DataLoader to load the augmented dataset and train the model.
